# Ecovacs Mower for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant custom integration for Ecovacs GOAT robot mowers, built to
work around defects in the upstream `ecovacs` integration that leave GOAT
mowers effectively unusable.

If you own a GOAT mower and its state in Home Assistant is stuck, and
start/pause do nothing, this is likely why:
[home-assistant/core#168621](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/168621).

## What's broken, and what this fixes

Home Assistant's built-in `ecovacs` integration talks to Deebot vacuums and
GOAT mowers through the same library, `deebot-client`. For GOAT mowers,
five independent bugs in that path add up to a mower that can't be
controlled and barely reports its own state:

| Defect | Effect |
|---|---|
| Control commands are sent to the MQTT topic `iot/p2p/clean_V2` | GOAT firmware listens on `iot/p2p/clean` and ignores `clean_V2` entirely. `start_mowing` and `pause` do nothing. |
| State refresh uses the command `getCleanInfo_V2` | GOAT mowers never answer it. Polled state refreshes silently fail. |
| Plain `getCleanInfo` is answered — with `idle`, always | Every state refresh replaces the real state with `idle`, which the library reads as "standing still". A mower that is out cutting reports `mowing` for a minute or two after it starts and `paused` for the hours that follow. |
| The unsolicited messages `onChargeInfo` and `onScheduleTaskInfo` have no handler | They're dropped as unknown messages. In practice this means the mower's state in Home Assistant only updates once a day, when it happens to reconnect and get polled. |
| Every login goes through the password endpoint, which answers `1013` for some accounts even after the device was verified | The config entry loops on "Device verification required": the emailed code is accepted, the reload logs in with the password, is refused, and another code is requested. The integration never finishes setting up. |

Net effect on the upstream integration: state lags by close to a day, and
the controls that are supposed to fix that don't work either.

This integration patches all five at the protocol layer (correct command, a
refresh call that is both answered and believed, handlers for both missing
messages, and a session renewal that does not touch the password endpoint) and
exposes a `lawn_mower` entity that reflects real state within seconds and
responds to start / pause / dock.

## Why a separate integration, instead of a fix upstream

The underlying library, `deebot-client`, has around twenty open pull
requests touching GOAT/mower support, the oldest opened in April. None have
merged, and no release since 18.5.1 (30 July) contains any mower work. In
the same period, vacuum and authentication changes to the same library have
merged within days. Two Home Assistant core pull requests adding mower
features were auto-closed as stale by the triage bot while waiting on those
library PRs to land.

In August the maintainer explained what blocks the `CleanMower` fix: the
library keys its command lookup on the command name alone, so two devices
cannot answer differently to the same name until that lookup is made
per-device. A refactor doing exactly that has been open since 21 August,
without a review.

This is not a criticism of the maintainers — they're volunteers, and review
bandwidth is finite. It's the reason a fork is the pragmatic way to get a
working mower today rather than waiting on a queue with no visible movement.

Relevant links, so you can check the state of things yourself. The status
in brackets is as of 10 September 2026:

- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1624](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/pull/1624) — fixes the `clean_V2` command (open; the maintainer's reply names the per-device command lookup as the prerequisite)
- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1772](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/pull/1772) — that per-device command lookup (open, unreviewed)
- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1647](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/pull/1647) — adds the two missing message handlers (closed by this integration's author on 29 August, after months as community-approved with no maintainer response; the handlers live here instead)
- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1650](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/issues/1650) — `getCleanInfo_V2` not answered by GOAT hardware (open)
- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1587](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/pull/1587) — RTK support (open, the author's July ping unanswered)
- [home-assistant/core#168621](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/168621) — the user-facing symptom report this integration exists to fix (open)
- [home-assistant/core#169723](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/169723) — mowers exposed with vacuum terminology (open)
- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1743](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/pull/1743) — password-free session renewal, the fix for the verification loop (open). One thing its thread turned up: the renewed session is only accepted from the same `device_id` that was verified, so the id has to survive restarts. This integration keeps it in the config entry, so it survives restarts.
- [home-assistant/core#178558](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/178558) — the core side of that fix, blocked on the library release (open, no review)

This integration does not depend on any of those merging. If they do,
the corresponding patch in this repo becomes dead code and gets deleted.

### Protocol work upstream that this integration does not have yet

Since August one contributor has opened a series of pull requests against
`deebot-client` built on traffic captured from a GOAT O1200 LiDAR Pro, the
class this integration was developed on. Those have not merged either, so
none of it can arrive as a library update, but the captured request and
response shapes are a ready map of what could be built here next without
sniffing the traffic again. Much of it already exists in this integration —
the mowing-progress sensor, the rain-delay switch and number, the volume
number and the map decoding all cover the same ground — and what remains is:

- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1774](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/pull/1774) — the names of the saved mowing areas, from `getAreaSet` with `type: "ar"`, on every model. Here they are read only on the A1600 LiDAR Pro, for its per-area parameter entities (see below), and the `mow_area` service takes area ids only.
- [DeebotUniverse/client.py#1778](https://github.com/DeebotUniverse/client.py/pull/1778) — the remaining global settings as settable values: animal protection with its schedule, AI recognition, smart mowing with avoidance, narrow-passage adaptation and the lifted-alarm volume. Only the read-only protection flags exist here, as binary sensors.

If one of these matters to you, open an issue and say so — that is how the
order of work here gets decided.

## Requirements

- **Home Assistant 2026.7 or later.** This is a hard floor, not a
  suggestion. `deebot-client` 18.6.0, the lowest version this integration
  accepts, requires `cryptography>=48.0.1` for its device-verification flow.
  Home Assistant 2026.4.4 pins `cryptography==46.0.7`. Those two
  requirements cannot coexist, so the integration cannot load at all on
  HA 2026.4.4 or older — it will fail to install, not fail at runtime. If
  you're on an older release, upgrade Home Assistant first.
- HACS, if installing that way (see below). Not required for manual install.

## Hardware support

Device classes the integration patches. "Confirmed" means someone has run
the mower on it and reported that controls, state and position work — not
merely that the class string was seen:

| Model | Device class | Confirmed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ecovacs GOAT O1200 LiDAR Pro** | `2i0fns` | the author's own hardware |
| **Ecovacs GOAT O800 RTK** | `9bts2s` | a user, firmware 1.13.8 ([#8](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/8)) |
| **Ecovacs GOAT O800 RTK** | `2px96q` | a user, controls and state confirmed — start/pause in [#24](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/24), state on firmware 1.17.11 in [#56](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/56). Firmware 1.17 speaks a second map dialect, decoded from two users' logs but not yet confirmed on hardware ([#41](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/41)) |
| **Ecovacs GOAT G1-800** | `77atlz` | a user, firmware 1.36.208 — the protection-flag sensors in [#30](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/30), start/pause/resume/dock from the `lawn_mower` entity in [#74](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/74). That firmware branch answers the `V2` command family instead of the one every other confirmed mower uses, and the integration detects and switches to it automatically, so no manual configuration is needed ([#42](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/42)); border mowing is built for this class from the request captured in [#12](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/12) and awaits confirmation on hardware |
| **Ecovacs GOAT A1600 LiDAR Pro** | `e4gqia` | a user, firmware 1.11.31 ([#29](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/pull/29)) — zone mowing confirmed ([#78](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/pull/78)) |
| **Ecovacs GOAT A1600 RTK** | `xmp9ds` | reported, patch not yet confirmed — firmware 1.17.9 ([#43](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/43)) |
| **Ecovacs GOAT A3000 LiDAR** | `o4kvvk` | reported working unpatched, patch not yet confirmed — firmware 1.13.31 ([#106](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/106)) |
| **Ecovacs GOAT O600 RTK** | `6n9pcz` | reported, patch not yet confirmed ([#103](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/103)) |
| **Ecovacs GOAT O1000 LiDAR Pro** | `0jbd6s` | reported, patch not yet confirmed — firmware 2.13.10 ([#102](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/102)). Ecovacs identifies it internally as an O1200 LiDAR Plus, and it gets the O1200's capabilities |

The A1600 ships as two machines, and they report different device classes:
the LiDAR Pro is `e4gqia`, the RTK is `xmp9ds`. Both rows above are real, and
neither is a second class string for the other.

The rest of the GOAT line shares the same three upstream defects described
above, and would very likely work with the same fix. Those models are not in
the list, because nobody has reported one.

If you install this on an unsupported model, the integration will still
load, but it will not patch that device's commands — meaning you'd be back
to the original symptoms (dead controls, stale state). It logs a warning
naming the device class it saw and didn't recognize, for example:

```
Mower class <class> is not supported by this integration and is used
unpatched: controls will likely not work and state will lag. Report the
model at <issue tracker> so it can be added
```

That device class string is exactly what to paste into a
[new issue](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues). Adding a
reported model to `SUPPORTED_CLASSES` is a small, low-risk change — this is
one of the more useful ways to contribute without touching Python. Saying
afterwards whether it actually worked is what turns the row into a confirmed
one.

## Installation

Remove Home Assistant's built-in `ecovacs` integration for this mower
first. Having both installed at once means two integrations racing to
control the same device.

### Via HACS (custom repository)

This integration is not in the HACS default store. Add it as a custom
repository:

1. HACS → the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Repository: `nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower`, category: **Integration**
3. Install "Ecovacs Mower" from HACS
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Settings → Devices & services → **Add integration** → search for
   "Ecovacs Mower"

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/ecovacs_mower` from this repository into your
   Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Settings → Devices & services → **Add integration** → search for
   "Ecovacs Mower"

### First-time setup: expect a verification code

Since July 2026, Ecovacs requires device verification for new client IDs
logging into an account. This integration registers as a new client,
separate from the built-in `ecovacs` integration, so the very first setup
will trigger it even if your account was already verified before.

During setup you may see error code `1013` ("Please update to the latest
version to continue") — this is that verification requirement, not a bug.
The config flow will prompt for a code emailed to your Ecovacs account.
Enter it and setup continues.

**You should only ever need one code.** For some accounts Ecovacs keeps
answering `1013` to the password login even after the device has been verified,
which in the built-in integration produces an endless loop: the code is
accepted, the entry reloads, the password login is refused again and another
code is requested ([home-assistant/core#177870][loop]). This integration stores
the account token the verification returns and renews its session with that
instead of the password, so a reload does not need a new code. If you are
already stuck in that loop on an older version of this integration, updating is
enough: Home Assistant will ask you to reauthenticate once, that one code gets
stored, and the entry stops asking. There is no need to delete and re-add it.

## What you get

Forty-three fixed entities on the mower's device page, across eight platforms —
forty-four on the G1-800, which alone gets the "Mow border" button — plus four
writable entities per saved mowing area on the A1600 LiDAR Pro (`e4gqia`) and
one per UWB beacon on the models that use them:

| Platform | Count | What |
|---|---|---|
| `lawn_mower` | 1 | Real state (`mowing`, `paused`, `returning`, `docked`, `error`) that updates within seconds, plus working `start_mowing`, `pause`, and `dock` |
| `sensor` | 16 + one per beacon | Activity (the mower's state with the reason folded in — `returning_rain`, `docked_rain_delay`; see below), battery, error code (disabled by default — see below), mowing progress (see below), job target area, job target duration, three lifetime totals (area, time, session count), four consumable-lifespan percentages (blade, lens brush, trimmer brush, weed rope), IP address, Wi-Fi signal strength, Wi-Fi network name, and on a beacon-guided mower one battery percentage per UWB beacon (see below) |
| `binary_sensor` | 6 | Fault — a latched problem that stays on until the mower recovers or you clear it (see below) — plus rain sensor, rain delay, emergency stop, locked, animal protection: the mower's raw protection flags, from the `onProtectState` message the library drops (see below) |
| `switch` | 8 | Advanced mode, TrueDetect obstacle avoidance, edge cutting, child lock, lift warning, boundary crossing warning, safety protection, rain detection (see below) |
| `number` | 3 + four per saved area on the A1600 LiDAR Pro | Notification volume, cutting direction, rain delay duration, plus cutting height, mowing speed, obstacle height and cutting direction for each saved area (see below) |
| `button` | 7, 8 on the G1-800 | Reset each of the four consumable lifespans, "Locate mower" (plays a sound on the device), "Clear fault" (releases the latched fault; see below), "End mowing task" (ends the current job for good; see below) and, on the G1-800, "Mow border" (starts a border job; see below) |
| `event` | 1 | Last mowing job (finished / finished with warnings / manually stopped — see below) |
| `image` | 1 | The mower's map — lawn boundary, mowed coverage, no-go zones, detected obstacles, the dock and the mower's live position track. Add it to a dashboard with a `picture-entity` card. Decoded from the GOAT's own map messages (`onMI`/`onArI`/`onMapTrack`/`onSpecialContour`, `onMapTrace` on firmware 1.17, and `onMapInfo_V2` on 1.36 — that last one only ever arrives in answer to a `getMapInfo_V2` the integration now sends); see `map.py` and `deebot_patch/map_messages.py` for the decoding. Geometry survives restarts; the position track is live-only. The mower's position, its heading, the dock and the path it has driven are also attributes of the entity (`position_x`, `position_y`, `heading`, `dock_x`, `dock_y`, `track`) — millimetres in the map's own frame, with the dock as the origin, `heading` in degrees as the mower reports it, and `track` a list of `[x, y]` points thinned to at most about 250 — so a card can draw the mower on something other than the SVG. `position_x`, `position_y` and `heading` are `null` until the mower has reported a position since Home Assistant started |

Not included yet: **RTK diagnostics** (position and satellite data). RTK is
planned for the next release.

### Zone-specific mowing

The `ecovacs_mower.mow_area` service starts a mowing job for one or more
specified zone IDs using the mower's `spotArea` command.

Zone mowing is currently confirmed only on the A1600 LiDAR Pro (`e4gqia`).
If you have another mower class, zone mowing is not yet verified on that
hardware; please report the device class in a new issue if you test it.

The service requires a mower entity as its target and accepts one or more
integer `area_ids` between `0` and `999`:

```yaml
action: ecovacs_mower.mow_area
target:
  entity_id: lawn_mower.my_goat
data:
  area_ids:
    - 1
    - 3
```

Multiple zones can be supplied in a single call. The service is stateless:
it sends the requested zones directly to the targeted mower and does not
attempt to determine whether the specified zones actually exist on the
mower.

Once a zone job is running, *Pause*, *Start* (which resumes it) and **End
mowing task** work on it like on any other job. The mower insists on being
told which kind of job it is in: a resume that names the wrong kind is
acknowledged and ignored, observed on an O1200 LiDAR
([#94](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/94)). The integration
therefore remembers the kind of job the mower last reported and names it on
those three commands, so a zone job started from the app or from this
service can be paused and resumed from Home Assistant alike.

The same service can also be used from Home Assistant's UI, where the mower
entity and one or more zone IDs can be selected.

The zone IDs are mower-specific. A value being within the accepted 0..999
range does not imply that the mower has a zone with that ID.

### Per-area mowing parameters

The A1600 LiDAR Pro (`e4gqia`) also exposes the settings stored for each
saved mowing area. The integration discovers the mower's current area IDs and
names at runtime and creates four writable `number` entities for each area:

| Setting | Home Assistant value |
|---|---|
| Cutting height | 3–9 cm |
| Mowing speed | 0.40–0.70 m/s |
| Obstacle height | 10, 15 or 20 cm |
| Cutting direction | 0–359° |

The entities use the numeric `areaID` for their identity, not the area's name.
The name shown by the mower is user-editable in the Ecovacs app, so changing
it does not create a new Home Assistant entity.

If an area is removed from the mower — deleted or re-mapped away — its four
entities become unavailable rather than disappearing or showing a stale
value. They recover automatically if an area with the same ID is reported
again.

The settings are read from the mower with `getAreaParameter` and `getAreaSet`.
The integration combines those responses into one authoritative area snapshot,
so a write can preserve the other settings. Changing one value therefore sends
one complete `setAreaParameter` request containing all four raw parameter
values rather than replacing the other three with defaults.

If the mower has not reported the complete parameter set for an area yet, the
integration refuses the write rather than guessing the missing values. The
entity state is also not changed optimistically: Home Assistant reflects the
value reported back by the mower.

Changes made anywhere — the Ecovacs app or Home Assistant — reach the other
within a couple hundred milliseconds, confirmed both directions. The mower
broadcasts its current area parameters to every connected client whenever
they change, not just to whoever made the change, and this integration
listens for that broadcast. There is no polling involved; nothing needs a
manual refresh for this to work. Reloading the integration, or restarting
Home Assistant, still refreshes the saved area name and all four parameter
values from the mower as a fallback — and so does manually calling Home
Assistant's "Update entity" action (`homeassistant.update_entity`) on any of
the area entities, without needing a reload.

These parameter mappings are currently confirmed only on the A1600 LiDAR Pro
(`e4gqia`). The raw Ecovacs fields have the same names on other mower models,
but that does not establish that their ranges, units or meanings are the same.
The integration therefore does not expose these controls on other classes until
their parameter representation has been independently verified.

### Border mowing

The *Edge cutting* switch is a setting: it decides whether an ordinary job
also trims the perimeter. Border mowing is a separate task the mower runs on
its own, and the **Mow border** button starts one — the same job the Ecovacs
app starts from its border-mowing action. While it runs the mower reports
`mowing`, the progress sensor tracks the strip along the boundary rather than
the lawn, and the map keeps updating.

The button exists only on classes where the request the app sends has been
captured, which today is the GOAT G1-800 (`77atlz`). If you have another
mower and would like the button, open an issue with a debug log of the app
starting a border job; the request shape and the device class are what it
needs.

The command names the mower's current map, which the integration learns from
the map messages the mower sends. Right after a restart that can take a few
seconds; pressing the button before then answers "The mower has not reported
its map yet; try again in a moment" and asks the mower for its map, so the
next press works.

### Ending a task

Sending the mower back to its dock does not end the job. The mower keeps it
as resumable — the app shows the unfinished progress with *End* and
*Continue* — and a later *Start* resumes it instead of beginning a fresh
cycle. The **End mowing task** button is the app's *End*: it ends the
current job for good, so the next start is a new one. Useful in automations
that interrupt a job during the day and want tomorrow's run to start from
scratch.

Ending a job does not bring the mower home. It stops where it is and stays
there, exactly as the app's *End* does — observed on an O1200 LiDAR
(`2i0fns`), where the mower went `idle` on the lawn and no return-to-dock
followed. The `lawn_mower` entity shows `paused` for a mower standing idle
off the dock, which is correct but easy to misread as "resumable". An
automation that wants the mower parked as well needs both actions, in
either order: **End mowing task** and then *Return to base*, or *Return to
base* first — the job stays resumable on the way home — and **End mowing
task** once it is docked.

The payload is confirmed on the G1-800 (`77atlz`), where the app's own
request was captured ([#51](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/51)).
On the O-series and A-series mowers it sends the same shape those mowers
already accept for *Pause*; if it does nothing on yours, a debug log of the
app's *End* on that mower is what settles it.

### When a run stops because of rain

A scheduled run cut short by rain is the case where the mower's own state is
not enough. The `lawn_mower` entity can only report what Home Assistant's
`LawnMowerActivity` allows — `mowing`, `paused`, `returning`, `docked`,
`error` — so it goes `mowing → paused → returning → docked` in about a
minute and then looks exactly like a run that finished normally.

The device does say why, in a `trigger` field on the state messages:

```
onScheduleTaskInfo   trigger:"rain"  motionState:"pause"
onChargeInfo         trigger:"rain"  state:"goCharging"
onChargeInfo         trigger:"workComplete"  state:"idle"     <- 56 s later
```

`sensor.<device>_activity` is built on that field. It reports the same state as
the `lawn_mower` entity with the reason folded in: `paused_rain`,
`returning_rain` and `docked_rain_delay` alongside the plain `mowing`,
`paused`, `returning`, `docked` and `error`. Put that on a dashboard if you
want to see *why* it is parked.

Note the third line above: the mower reports `workComplete` when it reaches the
dock even though rain is what sent it there. The rain reason is therefore held
until the mower actually cuts grass again — otherwise it would be discarded at
the exact moment you want to read it.

The five `binary_sensor` entities are the raw flags from `onProtectState`, one
per flag, with no interpretation on top.

`rain_protect` (`isRainProtect`) is the exception: it is presented as a live
rain reading, named **Rain sensor** and given the `moisture` device class, so it
reads Wet/Dry. Two samples rule out the reading one could not, with the mower's
rain protection switched on in both:

| sample | setting | `isRainProtect` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| two seconds before a rain-stopped run | `RainDetect: 1` *(settings message)* | `1` |
| dry day, mower parked under cover | on in the app | `0` |

A flag that moves while the setting stands still is not the setting. The second
sample — a `getProtectState` answer from firmware 1.13.10 — also had
`isAnimProtect: 0` with animal protection switched on, which rules the
"protection is enabled" reading out a second time — on a sibling flag rather
than this one, so it leans on the five flags being the same kind of thing.

That second witness cuts both ways: it means `animal_protect` is not the
animal-protection setting either, so the entity still named **Animal
protection** is named for something it is not. It is left alone because no
positive reading is established — one sample cannot separate "an animal is
detected" from "the mower is holding for an animal" — and a name that is
merely imprecise beats one that is confidently wrong (issue #45).

What the samples do *not* separate is a wet sensor from a mower currently held
for rain: both read `1` two seconds before a rain-stopped run and `0` on a dry
day under cover. `moisture` fits either way, and telling them apart needs the
same rain event `rain_delay` needs, below.

`rain_delay` is deliberately left alone: no device class, no rename. The
working theory is that it covers the configured post-rain hold (three hours on
the verified hardware), which would explain why the device reports it
separately from the sensor — `isRainProtect` drops back to `0` as soon as the
sensor dries off in the dock, while the mower is still waiting. That is
**unconfirmed**. Confirming it takes a rain event:

```
grep onProtectState home-assistant.log | tail -5
```

`isRainDelay` should go to `1` when the run breaks, stay `1` after
`isRainProtect` has fallen back to `0`, and clear after the configured delay
rather than when the grass dries. "The configured delay" now has an entity of
its own to check against — see the next section — but reading the setting is
not the same as watching the flag follow it, so the theory stands unconfirmed.

The mower's own rain-aware *states* still come from `trigger`, which needs no
interpretation, not from these flags.

Note that the display name feeds the entity id at first registration only:
installs that predate the **Rain sensor** rename keep
`binary_sensor.<device>_rain_protection`, while fresh ones get
`binary_sensor.<device>_rain_sensor`. Nothing breaks, but an automation snippet
naming this entity is install-dependent.

All five `binary_sensor` flags are asked for with `getProtectState` when Home
Assistant starts, and updated from the `onProtectState` push after that. The
device only pushes when a flag flips, so before that command was wired up
(issue #31) the flags stayed `unknown` through any dry, uneventful spell — and
from every restart.

The rain *reason* on `sensor.activity` is not restored by a restart, though — it
comes from `trigger`, which nothing can ask for, so a restart during an active
rain delay reads as plain `docked` until the mower's next scheduled run.

### The rain sensor's setting, and the four entities named for rain

`switch.<device>_rain_detection` and `number.<device>_rain_delay_duration` are
the setting itself: whether the mower listens to its rain sensor at all, and
how many minutes it waits before resuming once a run has been cut short. Both
come from `onRainDelay`, a message the library has no handler for, which
carries the pair in one payload:

```
{"enable": 1, "delay": 180}
```

Nothing on the wire says what `delay` counts in. Minutes is read off the
reporter's app, which showed three hours against that 180 (issue #54). The
entity's ceiling of one day is a generous guess, not a firmware limit; the
range mirrors [Janverhu/ecovacs-goat-g1][goat-g1], which drives the same
command against a GOAT G1.

Both are disabled by default, like every other settings entity here.

That makes four entities with rain in the name, and they are four different
things:

| Entity | Kind | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `switch` **Rain detection** | setting | Is the rain sensor switched on? |
| `number` **Rain delay duration** | setting | How long a hold does it trigger? |
| `binary_sensor` **Rain sensor** | reading | Is the sensor wet right now? |
| `binary_sensor` **Rain delay** | reading | Is the mower holding right now? |

The two settings are read at startup with `getRainDelay` and updated from the
`onRainDelay` push after that — the same arrangement as the protection flags,
and for the same reason: the device pushes only when the setting changes, so
without the command they would read `unknown` until someone opened the app.

Writing either one sends `setRainDelay`, which carries **both** fields. Each
entity therefore resends the half it does not own, unchanged, from the last
value the mower reported. If that half has never arrived, the write is refused
rather than guessed: a default would silently overwrite a hold the owner chose,
or switch their rain sensor off.

### When a job ends

`event.<device>_last_mowing_job` fires once each time a job stops for a known reason, with
`finished` or `manually_stopped` as the event type. It is the signal to
automate on for "the mowing is done" — the mower's state is not, because
`paused` covers a charge break and a rain pause as well as an ending.

Two sources feed it. The first is the one Home Assistant's own Ecovacs
integration uses, `reportStats`, which no GOAT has been observed to send:
across every capture taken so far, on two different classes and 28 job
endings, it has not arrived once, and the entity simply never fired. The
second is the mower's own stop announcement, which is what makes the entity
work here.

The announcement carries a reason, and only the two reasons that have actually
been observed are mapped: a completed job and one stopped from the app.
`finished_with_warnings` stays reachable from `reportStats` alone, since
nothing on the wire is known to mean it — firing it on a guess would tell an
automation a job ended cleanly when nobody knows that. A mower that does send
`reportStats` keeps using it: the first answer from it stands the second source
down for good. If such a mower turns up and its announcement happens to
arrive first, that single ending is reported twice before the switch settles;
nothing observed says any GOAT sends both.

### How far along the mower is

`sensor.<device>_mowing_progress` reports the percentage of the running job that
is cut — the same figure the Ecovacs app shows next to the zone size.

The device answers `getStats` with three numbers, of which `deebot-client` keeps
two. The third, `mowedArea`, is the only one that moves during a run: `area` is
the *target* area of the current job and holds still while `mowedArea` climbs
towards it. The sensor is the ratio of the two, so the unit cancels — which
matters for edge cutting, where the target is the strip along the boundary rather
than the lawn.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Between jobs it holds the last job's figure**, and a bare telemetry zero
  cannot reset it: most firmware reports zeros when nothing is running, and a
  0 there would be indistinguishable from a job that has just started; some
  firmware never zeroes at all and keeps reporting the finished job's numbers,
  which is why the entity refuses to read the payload at all while the mower
  is parked. What resets the reading — to 0, not unknown — is the mower
  announcing that a job ended, acted on when the next one begins: unlike a
  telemetry zero, that announcement removes the ambiguity, since it is the
  device itself saying a new job has started. It is not the mower parking,
  since a run that docks to charge and resumes is one job and keeping its
  figure through the break is the point. On a mower that never sends those
  announcements the figure simply stands until real numbers replace it, so the
  first minutes of a job can still show the previous one's.
- **"Finished" is not this entity's job.** A completed run publishes its final
  figure here, but that figure is not always 100: for a zone the target is the
  polygon's estimate, and a mower that considers itself done after 24 of 32 m²
  reports 76 %. What to automate on instead is `event.<device>_last_mowing_job`,
  which fires `finished` when the mower says a job completed — not
  `lawn_mower.<device>` going from `mowing` to `paused`, which also covers a
  charge break and a manual or rain pause (see below) and so cannot tell a
  finished job from either of those.
- **It follows the push where there is one, and a poll where there is not.**
  Some mowers send `onStats` several times a second while cutting; others have
  been observed not to. Where it arrives, the reading tracks the mower, and a
  whole percent has to change before the entity writes a new state. Where it
  does not, a poll fills in: one request at startup to sync, then every five
  minutes while a run is in progress, stopping when the mower parks. A run
  interrupted by charging needs no special case — the mower docks, the poll
  stops, and it starts again when the job resumes. The poll is also why the
  final figure comes from elsewhere: its five-minute cadence rarely lands on the
  last percent of a run, so the reading is completed from the job-finished
  message the mower pushes at the same moment.

`paused` is deliberately not a reason to stop asking: it is a normal mid-run
state (rain, a manual pause), not a sign the job has ended, and the poll keeps
going regardless of which non-docked state the mower is currently in.

The same poll refreshes the job-target-area and job-target-duration sensors,
which the device otherwise leaves untouched between restarts. Named after what
they actually hold — GOAT's `getStats` reports the running job's target, not
what has been cut or elapsed so far; only `mowedArea` climbs during a run.

### The UWB beacons

On a beacon-guided GOAT, each beacon gets its own sensor:

```
sensor.<device>_beacon_<serial>    83 %
```

The serial is the code the Ecovacs app prints next to each beacon on its own
maintenance page, so the two agree on which one is which. They are batteries as
far as Home Assistant is concerned — `device_class: battery` — which means the
built-in low-battery handling applies without anyone writing a template.

Issue #40 proposed `sensor.<device>_beacon_<sn>_battery` with the serial as an
attribute; this drops the `_battery` suffix since `device_class: battery`
already says what the reading is, and the serial moved into the entity id and
name since it is already the unique identifier for the sensor.

They appear once the mower has first reported its beacons, not at setup: the
payload is what says how many there are and what they are called, and nothing
else does. A beacon that stops being reported keeps its entity and reads unknown
rather than holding the dead cell's last charge; deleting it is a manual step in
the entity registry, deliberately, because a poll that failed is not proof that
a beacon is gone.

`deebot-client` drops these. Its `LifeSpan` enum has no member for the
`uwbCell` component, and it raises on one rather than skipping it — which took
the rest of the answer with it, since the parser publishes as it goes. On a
G1-800 the components arrive in the order blade, beacons, lens brush, so the
blade percentage worked, the beacons were invisible, **and the lens brush
reported a value from before the beacons were paired that could never change.**
That last one is fixed here too, as a side effect of not giving up on the
answer.

Parsing the beacons is only half of it: they also have to be asked for. The
mower answers `getLifeSpan` with the components the request lists, and the
library lists the ones it builds entities for — blade and lens brush on the
beacon-guided models, never a beacon — so its own poll never came back with a
beacon in it. The Ecovacs app asks with an empty
list and gets everything, and so does this integration (issue #100). Until that
was fixed, the beacon sensors only appeared if an `onUWB` push (below) arrived
after a restart, and stayed unavailable until one did.

#### Two sources, and they do not always agree

The mower also pushes the beacon batteries on its own, in an `onUWB` message the
library has no handler for either. That push is what fills the sensors in when
`getLifeSpan` is not answered — which happens on firmware 1.36.208, where polls
return `errno 500` intermittently or constantly — and it fills them in faster
after a restart, since it does not wait for a round trip.

The two numbers are **not** interchangeable. On the four beacons this was
captured against, three matched exactly and one read a round `100` in the push
against `83` in `getLifeSpan`, in every sample across two days. Which one is
correct cannot be settled from the wire; the only hint is that the push is the
one reporting a round `100` where the other reports less, which is what
saturating at the top of a range looks like.

So the sensor picks deliberately rather than showing whichever arrived last: the
`getLifeSpan` reading always wins, and a pushed one is only ever used for a
beacon the poll has not reported. Otherwise the disputed beacon would flap
between 83 % and 100 % and no low-battery automation built on it could be
trusted.

#### There is no per-beacon reset button, and none is needed

The beacon percentage is a live measurement, not a consumable counter like the
blade. Replacing a flat cell brought its reading back to 100 % on its own, with
no reset command sent by anything — Home Assistant or the Ecovacs app — across a
capture that contained every command either of them sent. So unlike the blade
and the lens brush, there is nothing for a reset button to do. Issue #63 is
closed on that basis.

### Entities disabled by default

**17 of the 40 entities** ship with `entity_registry_enabled_default=False`,
all inherited unchanged from upstream Home Assistant core's `ecovacs`
integration — they're advanced settings or diagnostics, off by default
there too. They appear in the mower's entity list right after setup, but
stay disabled and report no state until you turn them on by hand (device
page → the entity → the cog icon → enable). That's expected behaviour, not
a bug: if one of these looks blank or "unavailable," this is why.

| Platform | Disabled | Which |
|---|---|---|
| `switch` | 7 of 7 | all of them: advanced mode, TrueDetect, edge cutting, child lock, lift warning, boundary crossing warning, safety protection |
| `number` | 2 of 2 | both: volume, cutting direction |
| `sensor` | 4 of the 16 fixed ones | IP address, Wi-Fi signal strength, Wi-Fi network name, and **error code**. The per-beacon sensors are enabled |
| `button` | 4 of 7 (4 of 8 on the G1-800) | the four consumable-lifespan resets (blade, lens brush, trimmer brush, weed rope) — "Locate mower", "Clear fault", "End mowing task" and, on the G1-800, "Mow border" are enabled by default |

**If you're planning anything on the error sensor** — an alarm, a
notification, a dashboard card — note that it does not exist as an
enabled entity out of the box. `sensor.<device>_error` is created disabled
and reports nothing until you enable it by hand, same as the other 16
above. This is the one entity in this list someone is likely to go
looking for by name, so it's worth repeating here rather than only in the
table.

For an alarm, though, **`binary_sensor.<device>_fault` is the one you
want** — it is enabled by default and, unlike the error sensor, it does
not go back to "fine" on its own. See the next section.

### A fault that stays until something actually clears it

`sensor.<device>_error` reports the last code the mower sent. On firmware
1.36.208 that turned out to be useless for alarming
([#53](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/53)): a blade-disc
jam pushed `code:[406]` exactly once and was followed **89 milliseconds
later** by `code:[0]` — and then by another 3076 zeros over the 38 minutes
the mower sat stuck on the lawn draining its battery. The error sensor read
`0` the whole time, and `lawn_mower` read `paused`, which is
indistinguishable from a pause by hand. Nothing an automation could fire on
existed for longer than a tenth of a second.

The zeros are not the mower saying it recovered — they keep arriving at
about 1.4 per second whatever the machine is doing. So
`binary_sensor.<device>_fault` ignores them entirely. It goes `on` for any
non-zero code and goes `off` only when something says the fault is really
over:

- the mower **docks**, or
- the mower **starts mowing** again, or
- you press **Clear fault**.

The code and its text ride along as attributes, so a notification can name
the fault without reading the error sensor:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Mower is stuck
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.goat_fault
        to: "on"
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
        data:
          message: >
            Mower fault {{ state_attr('binary_sensor.goat_fault', 'code') }}:
            {{ state_attr('binary_sensor.goat_fault', 'description') }}
```

There is deliberately **no timer and no counter** here — no "clear after
five minutes of no error", no "clear after ten zeros in a row". The zero
flood is unbounded: it lasted exactly as long as it took the owner to walk
out to the mower, so no threshold can tell recovery from a heartbeat. If
you want a delay, put it in your own automation with `for:`, where you can
tune it.

**Clear fault** needs nothing from the mower — it releases local state — so
it works while the machine is unreachable, and it is what guarantees the
fault cannot get stuck if some firmware never reports docking or mowing.
Every latch and release is logged at INFO with the reason, which is the
evidence to attach to an issue if it ever behaves oddly.

The latch itself lives in memory only: restarting Home Assistant or
reloading the integration clears it, and it comes back only if the mower
still reports a non-zero code when the integration starts back up.

### Error codes without a description

The error sensor's state is the raw code; its `description` attribute is the
text for it. That text comes from `deebot-client`, whose table predates the
mower line, so a GOAT-only code arrives with no description at all
([#37](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/37)). The integration
fills the gaps it knows about:

| Code | Description | Ecovacs app also suggests |
|---|---|---|
| 422 | Weak signal. Return to the station. | clean the panoramic camera, the AI front camera and the ToF sensor; mow in daylight, not in heavy rain |
| 406 | Blade-disc blocked! Blade-disc cannot rotate. | — |

A code in neither table leaves the attribute empty and logs a warning naming
the code, once per code per restart. **That warning is the ask:** report the
code together with what the Ecovacs app shows for the same alarm in
[#37](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/37), and it can be
added here. The app is the only authoritative source — Ecovacs publishes no
code reference for GOAT.

## Collecting logs

The **Show logs** button on the integration page filters Home Assistant's log
for the literal string `ecovacs_mower`, and nothing else. Almost everything
worth reading — command timeouts, the MQTT traffic, the raw map messages — is
logged by `deebot_client`, and those lines do not contain that string. So the
panel reports "No issues found for the search term 'ecovacs_mower'" even when
the log is full of relevant lines ([#26](https://github.com/nord-/ha-ecovacs-mower/issues/26)).
The filter comes from the Home Assistant frontend, which builds it from the
integration's domain; it cannot be changed from here.

The integration does log its own warning when the mower does not confirm a
command it was sent, so a failed start or pause shows up under the domain
filter — but the reason for it is in `deebot_client`'s lines, not ours.

To get a usable log:

1. Turn on **Enable debug logging** on the integration page. That covers both
   `custom_components.ecovacs_mower`, which Home Assistant always adds for the
   integration itself, and `deebot_client`, which it adds because
   `manifest.json` lists it under `loggers`. The equivalent in
   `configuration.yaml`, if you prefer it to survive restarts:

   ```yaml
   logger:
     logs:
       custom_components.ecovacs_mower: debug
       deebot_client: debug
   ```

2. Reproduce the problem.
3. Go to **Settings → System → Logs**, clear the search box or search for
   `deebot`, and use **Download full log**. The search only looks at the lines
   already loaded in the browser, so downloading beats scrolling.

For anything about the map, `deebot_client` at debug level is the only thing
that shows whether the mower sends `onMI`/`onArI`/`onMapTrack`/
`onSpecialContour` — or `onMapTrace`, which firmware 1.17 sends instead of
`onMapTrack`, or `onMapInfo_V2`, which is 1.36's replacement for `onMI` — at
all. That is the log to attach to a map issue, and the `info` fields have to
be left intact: they are the map geometry itself.

On firmware older than 1.36, the `getMapInfo_V2` the integration sends at
setup and after every reconnect may go unanswered, which `deebot_client` logs
as `Command "getMapInfo_V2" was not successfully.` or `No response received
for command "getMapInfo_V2"`. That warning is expected and harmless — the
request is never retried and the boundary those firmwares push unasked as
`onMI` arrives regardless. It is still worth reporting with the log around
it: nobody has captured what pre-1.36 firmware answers here, and that capture
is what would justify picking between `getMapInfo` and `getMapInfo_V2` per
mower the way the clean commands already do.

## Current status

The `lawn_mower` entity is confirmed working against a real O1200: state
tracks the mower within seconds, and `start_mowing`, `pause`, and `dock` all
do what they should. It is also the one entity here that polls, every five
minutes: the mower does not always announce that it has finished and docked,
and without a poll the entity keeps reporting the run it is no longer doing. Its start command is also confirmed on an O800 RTK by
the user who reported that model.

The test suite, hassfest and HACS validation all pass in CI. The HACS job
skips the `brands` check, which requires an icon in the Home Assistant brands
repository — a requirement for listing in the HACS default store that does
not affect installation as a custom repository.

See the [Hardware support](#hardware-support) table above for which entities
have been confirmed against real hardware, model by model. If you install this
and something doesn't match what's documented here, an issue report is
useful — include your device class from the warning above if you're not on
one of the models in the table.

"""Password-free renewal of the portal credentials.

Backport of the still-unreleased upstream fix (DeebotUniverse/client.py#1743,
wired into the core integration by home-assistant/core#178558) onto
deebot-client 18.6.0, the lowest version the manifest accepts, which has
neither an ``account_credentials`` seed nor ``login_with_account``.

Why it is needed: for some accounts Ecovacs answers ``user/login`` with code
1013 ("Please update to the latest version to continue") even for a device ID
that was verified by email minutes earlier, and the library raises that as
``DeviceVerificationRequiredError``. Home Assistant finishes the config flow,
reloads the entry, builds a fresh ``Authenticator`` that knows nothing but the
password, hits 1013 and asks for verification again — the loop of
home-assistant/core#177870, reported here as issue #21.

The way out is that the ``uid`` + ``accessToken`` pair returned by both
``user/login`` and ``user/verifyDevice`` mints fresh portal credentials through
``getAuthCode`` + ``loginByItToken``, neither of which involves the password.
Persisting that pair in the config entry is what makes a reload survive without
a new email code.

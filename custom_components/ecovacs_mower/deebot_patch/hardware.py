"""Seeds deebot-client's device cache with corrected capabilities.

``get_static_device_info()`` reads the ``_DEVICES`` cache before importing the
device module. By letting the library build its own definition, swapping out
the broken parts and putting the result back, we avoid monkeypatching any
function — we use the same mechanism the library itself uses.

This module also owns the supported mower-class profiles. The profile records
only integration capabilities that have been independently validated for a
specific class; raw protocol parsing remains in the patch layer and
human-facing interpretation remains in the HA layer.

#   9bts2s — GOAT O800 RTK (user-verified, issue #8)
#   2px96q — GOAT O800 RTK (user-verified, issue #24). A second class string
#            for the same hardware: upstream's 2px96q.py is byte-identical to
#            9bts2s.py.
#   77atlz — GOAT G1-800 (issue #30, firmware 1.36.208 — controls
#            user-verified from the lawn_mower entity, issue #74: start,
#            pause/resume and dock all obeyed on 0.7.2). Upstream's 77atlz.py
#            is byte-identical to 9bts2s.py, docstring included, so the O800
#            RTK's patch applies unchanged — but this firmware branch inverts
#            the quirk the patch exists for. Issue #42 has the A/B on one
#            install: patched, getCleanInfo answers errno 500 on every poll
#            and clean is never acknowledged; unpatched, getCleanInfo_V2
#            answers first try and clean_V2 is acked in 526 ms. The class
#            stays here because the family is now chosen at runtime rather
#            than by this tuple — see families.py. Zone mowing is confirmed
#            on it too (``mow_area``, firmware 1.36.208), see
#            ZONE_AREA_CLASSES.
#   e4gqia — GOAT A1600 LiDAR Pro (confirmed, PR #29, firmware 1.11.31).
#            Upstream names this A3000 LiDAR Pro; its module is byte-identical
#            to 9bts2s.py apart from the docstring, so the O800's patch
#            applies unchanged.
#   xmp9ds — GOAT A1600 RTK (reported in issue #43, firmware 1.17.9 — the
#            reporter has not confirmed the patch yet). A different machine
#            from e4gqia above, not a second class string for it: the RTK and
#            LiDAR Pro variants of the A1600 ship separately. Upstream's
#            xmp9ds.py is byte-identical to 9bts2s.py apart from the docstring,
#            which here names the model outright ("DEEBOT GOAT A1600 RTK
#            Capabilities"), so the O800 RTK's patch applies unchanged.
#   o4kvvk — GOAT A3000 LiDAR (reported in issue #106, firmware 1.13.31 — the
#            reporter ran it unpatched, so the patch itself is not confirmed
#            yet). Upstream's docstring calls it "GOAT G1", the same kind of
#            misnaming as e4gqia above; its module is byte-identical to
#            9bts2s.py, docstring aside, so the O800 RTK's patch applies
#            unchanged.
#   6n9pcz — GOAT O600 RTK (reported in issue #103 with the unpatched
#            symptoms: start and stop only, state lagging). Upstream's
#            6n9pcz.py is byte-identical to 9bts2s.py, docstring included.
#   0jbd6s — GOAT O1000 LiDAR Pro (reported in issue #102, firmware 2.13.10).
#            The cloud reports its internal model as
#            GOAT_INT_O1200_LIDAR_PLUS_NA, and upstream's 0jbd6s.py is
#            byte-identical to 2i0fns.py, docstring included — so the O1200's
#            patch applies unchanged, not the O800's.
#
# Presence in this mapping means the class is supported by the integration.
# Capability flags are deliberately narrower: they are enabled only where the

# validated on that class. Similar protocol field names on another class are

    Six corrections:

    * ``clean.action.command``: ``CleanV2`` publishes on ``clean_V2``, which
      GOAT firmware ignores. Swapped for ``CleanMower`` on ``clean``.
    * ``clean.action.area``: expose the verified GOAT ``spotArea`` area-clean
      command for the A1600 LiDAR Pro. Existing library area commands are
      preserved for other classes.
    * ``state``: the clean-info answer is a constant ``idle`` regardless of
      what the mower is actually doing (issue #48), and the library ran the
      charge and clean-info answers concurrently in one ``TaskGroup`` — a
      race that let a mower parked on its charger read as docked or as paused
      depending on which answer landed last (issue #67). Swapped for
      ``MowerStateRefresh``, one sequential command that awaits the charge
      half before asking for clean info, so the record is written before the
      clean-info answer is interpreted; the clean-info half picks its own
      command name, ``getCleanInfo`` or ``getCleanInfo_V2``, from whichever
      the mower answers at runtime — see ``families.py``.
    * ``stats.clean``: ``GetStats`` drops ``mowedArea``, the one number that
      moves while a job runs. Swapped for ``GetStatsMower``.
    * ``life_span.get``: ``GetLifeSpan`` asks only for the components the
      library has entities for, and the mower answers only what it is asked,
      so the beacons never arrive (issue #100); when they do, it raises on the
      ``uwbCell`` entries and loses every component listed after them. Swapped
      for ``GetLifeSpanMower``, which asks for everything.
    * ``MowerProtectStateEvent``, ``MowerRainDelayEvent``, ``MowerStatsEvent``
      and ``MowerBeaconsEvent``: given the refresh commands they had none of.
    * ``MowerMapInfoEvent``: given ``GetMapInfoV2``, without which firmware
      1.36 never sends the lawn boundary at all — it answers the request and
      pushes at no other time (issue #81).

    The call is idempotent and does nothing for classes outside
    ``SUPPORTED_CLASSES``.

    **Must be called before ``ApiClient.get_devices()``.** That method calls
    ``get_static_device_info()`` and bakes the result into ``DeviceInfo.static``,
    which is a frozen dataclass. Patching the cache afterwards means the devices
    already got the unpatched capabilities.

    #
    # Without it the event bus finds no command when the first binary sensor
    # subscribes, and the device only pushes onProtectState when a flag flips:
    # through a dry, uneventful spell nothing arrives at all, so the entities
    # read "unknown" until the weather changes (issue #31). MowerRainDelayEvent
    # is the same trap one setting over: onRainDelay arrives only when somebody
    # changes the rain sensor, so its switch and number would sit at "unknown"
    # until the owner next opened the app (issue #54).
    #
    # This has to stay below the replace() above and cannot move up: replace()
    # re-runs __post_init__, which rebuilds the mapping from the fields, and an
    # entry that no field describes would be dropped without a word. A future
    # correction goes above this one for the same reason.
    #
    # StatsEvent (via stats.clean, above) and MowerStatsEvent (here) are two
    # independent keys in that mapping, each carrying its own GetStatsMower.
    # Both are first-subscribed early — StatsEvent by Device.__init__ itself,
    # MowerStatsEvent by the progress sensor — so an unavailable->available
    # flap, which refreshes every registered event type, sends two identical
    # getStats requests instead of one. Accepted: deduping identical commands
    # across event types would mean changing the event bus itself, and the
    # cost is one extra request on a rare transition, not a wrong answer.
    #
    # LifeSpanEvent and MowerBeaconsEvent share the same pattern for the same
    # getLifeSpan command: LifeSpanEvent is first-subscribed by the blade
    # sensor, MowerBeaconsEvent by the beacon platform setup in sensor.py, so
    # every mower — beacon-equipped or not — asks twice at startup and on
    # every reconnect. Both parse the one answer correctly; only the extra
    # round trip is paid.
    #
    # MowerMapInfoEvent is a different case from all of the above: it is not a
    # push the mower may forget to send, it is a push the mower never sends
    # unasked. Firmware 1.36 answers getMapInfo_V2 with the lawn outline on
    # the atr topic and sends it at no other time, so without an entry here
    # the boundary never arrives at all and the map stays a coverage patch
    # with no field around it (issue #81). controller._setup_map subscribes
    # MowerMapInfoEvent eagerly, so this alone gets the request sent at setup
    # and again on every reconnect — no new lifecycle code, and no risk of a
    # command firing before the device exists. The answer is an ack; the
    # payload lands separately in OnMapInfo, which is why this refresh
    # publishes no event of its own and why that is fine — see GetMapInfoV2.

"""Zone-specific mowing commands for GOAT mowers.

The ``spotArea`` payload shape was reverse-engineered by
PhilippF1992/ecovacs_goat_zonal_additions (MIT licensed) and confirmed by
the PR author on an A1600 LiDAR Pro (``e4gqia``), firmware 1.11.31, and
later on a G1-800 (``77atlz``), firmware 1.36.208, where it goes out on
``clean_V2``.

The command is deliberately stateless: the mower already stores the zone and
its mowing parameters. The command only sends the saved area IDs; reading or
changing those parameters is out of scope.

"""In-memory map state for one mower.

Pure Python: no Home Assistant, no deebot-client. Fed by the controller
from the map events; consumed by map_svg.py. Position track and marker are
deliberately volatile — after a restart the marker defaults to the dock
and the first onPos corrects it within seconds (KISS decision, 2026-08-10).

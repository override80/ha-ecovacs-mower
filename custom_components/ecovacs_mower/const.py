# Only the life span components a lawn mower actually has. Core exposes 12 of
# the ``LifeSpan`` enum's 26 members (vacuum-oriented — mops, dust bags,
# filters, UV lamp). BLADE and LENS_BRUSH are on that list, but TRIMMER_BRUSH
# and WEED_ROPE are not there at all: they are mower-specific components core
# never exposes, not a trimmed subset of its list. That is why they needed their
# own entries in icons.json.

# The mower is not a reliable narrator of its own state. On 2026-08-21 it
# finished a run, drove home and started charging without sending
# onChargeInfo, onChargeState, or even the bury-point task events it logs for
# itself — while onStats, onBattery, onPos and onMapTrack all kept arriving.
# That missing bury point is also the recorded case of the completion the
# progress sensor reads its final percentage from going astray (issue #73),
# which is why nothing downstream of it may depend on its arriving.
# The entity stayed "mowing" for two hours; one homeassistant.update_entity
# corrected it in 200 ms, over REST, so the answer was there the whole time
# and nobody had asked for it.
#
# Five minutes: worst case the state is that stale, against three commands per
# interval on Ecovacs' cloud API (state, stats and, while the mower is out,
# its position). Push still does the fast path — this only catches what push
# drops.
#
# Owned by EcovacsController rather than any one entity: lawn_mower, activity
# and mowing_progress/stats can each be individually disabled in the entity
# registry, and this has to keep running regardless of which of them are.
